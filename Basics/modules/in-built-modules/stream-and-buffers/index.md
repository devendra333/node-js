Buffers  

30 Cpacity  


if 100 person arrives 

30 
70 in queue 

if 2 people arrive , he needs to waiut for atleast 10 people to arrive ( to increase effcilrcy )

Butyou cannot contrl the pace at which people arive 


the atea where people wait is BUFFER ( GENERAALY 64kb chubks are processes)


if there is alrady data is processing or too little data , node puts that in to a buffer 


It is interantilloy small area that node maintains in the runtime to [rocess a strrwam of data 
]

Buffer have finite space 
If upcomg stream of data is too fast , then it have to wait untill buffer is clear  




Stream : 
passing data of dmall chunks through a pipe
