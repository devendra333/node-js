# Node.js and JavaScript Engines

## Node.js Overview
Node.js is an open-source, cross-platform JavaScript runtime environment. It allows developers to execute JavaScript code outside of a web browser. Node.js is built on the V8 JavaScript engine, which is developed by Google for use in the Chrome browser.

## JavaScript Engines
A JavaScript engine is a program that converts JavaScript code into machine code, enabling computers to perform specific tasks. Major web browser vendors typically develop these engines. Examples include:

- **V8** - Developed by Google for Chrome.
- **SpiderMonkey** - Developed by Mozilla for Firefox.

## Chrome V8 Engine and Node.js
The V8 engine is written in C++ and can run standalone or be embedded into any C++ program. This feature allows developers to create custom C++ programs that can execute ECMAScript and additional features available in C++ but not in JavaScript.

By embedding V8 into a C++ application, developers can write C++ code that gets executed when a user writes JavaScript code.

### Node.js and V8
Node.js is essentially a C++ program that embeds the V8 engine. This setup provides JavaScript with access to lower-level system features such as the file system and network operations.

## History of Node.js
In 2009, Ryan Dahl began working on high-latency, low-throughput sockets for I/O-bound tasks while using Ruby. He needed an asynchronous event loop, which JavaScript already had, leading to the creation of Node.js.

## JavaScript Runtime
A JavaScript runtime environment provides all the necessary components to run a JavaScript program. The JS engine is just a part of this environment. Other components include APIs for handling HTTP requests, the file system, and more.

Node.js provides these components to run JavaScript outside of the browser.

## Node.js Code Repository Structure

### Deps Folder
The `deps` folder contains external code that Node.js requires for JavaScript functionality:

- **V8** - Chrome's JavaScript engine.
- **libuv** - An open-source library providing Node.js access to underlying OS features like the file system and network layer.
- **zlib** - For compression.
- **crypto** - For cryptographic functions.

### Source Folder
The `src` folder contains the C++ source code for the Node.js runtime. It sets up C++ features like file system and network handling.

### Lib Folder
The `lib` folder contains JavaScript code that provides access to C++ features. For example, JavaScript developers can access the file system via the `fs` module.

## Conclusion
Node.js extends JavaScript's capabilities by providing a runtime environment that includes components for executing JavaScript outside of the browser. Its integration with the V8 engine and additional libraries like `libuv` allows it to handle system-level tasks efficiently.
